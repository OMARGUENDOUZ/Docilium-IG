# Clinical Trial Pharmacy Management Implementation Guide

## Introduction

The **Clinical Trial Pharmacy Management (CTPM) Implementation Guide** defines FHIR profiles, extensions, and workflows for managing investigational medicinal products (IMP) and non-investigational medicinal products (NIMP) in clinical trial pharmacy settings.

This Implementation Guide provides a standardized, interoperable approach to:
- **Drug accountability** and inventory management
- **Dispensing workflows** with weight-based and BSA-based dosing
- **Temperature monitoring** and cold chain integrity
- **IWRS integration** (Manual, CSV, and API modes)
- **Audit trails** with e-signatures for GCP/GMP compliance
- **Destruction workflows** (local vs sponsor-managed)
